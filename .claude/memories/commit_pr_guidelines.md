# Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Commit messages follow the format: `type(scope): description`
- Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`
- Examples: `feat(core): support model switching during runtime`, `fix(ui): slash command completion`
- Keep commits atomic and focused on single changes
- Use English only for commit messages
